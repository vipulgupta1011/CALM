He poured the crumbs onto a plate. He put some flour on another plate and added some salt and pepper and mixed them with the flour. Next, Allan cracked two eggs into a bowl and added a couple of spoonfuls of water. With a fork, he quickly stirred the egg and water until they were blended together. Allan put a large frying pan on his stove and turned on the burner. He added oil to about a half an inch. While the oil was heating, he took one fillet in his right hand and set it in the flour mixture and completely covered the fish. He then took the fillet and dipped it in the egg and then set the fish on the cracker crumbs. He turned the fish and pressed on the crumbs until the fillet was coated. He then carefully set the breaded fillet into the hot oil. When the edges of the fillet were starting to brown, he took tongs and carefully turned the fillet over. In just a few minutes, the bottom edges were also browning so he removed the fish from the pan with the tongs. He set the fish on some paper towels to soak up the excess oil and then moved it to his dinner plate.",
