First, I chopped my onion and put it into the big pot with some olive oil. I stirred them frequently while they cooked. Next, I added some garlic into the pot. I then added some ground beef. I mixed it together and let it cook until it was browned. I then added a big carton of beef stock, some water, and a can of stewed tomatoes. I then chopped my bell peppers into small pieces and added them to the pot. I let the soup slowly boil until the peppers were soft. At the end, I threw in a handful of Italian bread crumbs and some Parmesan cheese for some flavor. I was so excited to serve up a bowl and eat it.",

        "context": "It was night time and it was time to go to bed.  The boy wanted to keep playing.  I told him that after he got ready for bed I would read a story to him.  He dawdled a bit but finally started getting ready for bed.  First of all he had to take a bath.  He splashed in the tub and spilt water all over the floor.  Next he dried off in a big, fluffy blue towel.  Then he brushed his teeth with his special Star Wars toothbrush.  Next he dressed in his Star Wars underwear and then put on his Star Wars pajamas.  His dad and I tucked him into his bed that was made with Star Wars sheets.  He said his prayers.  Next was story time.  I pulled out his favorite book about (you guessed it) Star Wars.  He gradually dozed off dreaming about Anakin Skywalker and a galaxy far, far away.",
