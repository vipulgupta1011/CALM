After researching and finding one online I was well on my way to going to see my friend <PERSON> . I drive to the station and decide that I am going to purchase a round trip ticket as this would be cheaper than just buying both tickets separately . I purchase my ticket and then go to sit down and wait for my train . Whenever my train arrives I have to get in line as they process our tickets . After all this is done I decide to take a seat by the window . I sit and fall asleep a bit as I ride on the train for hours . After a couple hours we finally reach the destination and I get off the train , excited to see my friend . ",
